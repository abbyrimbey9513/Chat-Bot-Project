This project implements three patterns: Observer, Strategy and Template Method.
The User is the subject of the observer pattern while the ChatBots are the
observers to the user.

The ChatBots all implement the template method pattern.
The base class is ChatBots and the template method is enterChat().
All the bots enter the chat by adding themselves as observers to
User. Then getting the filename containing their responses.
Opening the file and creating a hash to hold the responses.
Then they say their greeting and set up their response strategies.
The subclasses that follow this template method are AngryChatBot, HappyChatBot,
and DepressedChatBot.
The update method, a requirement for the observers in the Observe pattern,
is the same for all chat bots and is in the ChatBot class. The update method
is also the method that determines what strategy the chat bot wants to use to
respond to the user. Here is where the strategy method occurs.
Every chat bot needs to respond to the user but depending on whether or not
the user string matches a key in the chat bot response hash, asks a question,
or says one word, determines how the bot responds. Once it has been determined
what type of strategy the bot should use, the generateResponse method is called
for that response strategy class.
If the strategy of choice is to end the conversation. The bot says their
good bye and deregisters as an observer.
